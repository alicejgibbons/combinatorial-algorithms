# Combinatorial Algorithms

StronglyConnectedComponents: Linear time program that finds the strongly connected components of a graph using Tarjan's algorithm ([a link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm)).

Usage: java StronglyConnectedComponents scctest.txt

SnakeCubeSolver: Program to solve a 3x3x3 Snake Cube puzzle ([a link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_cube)). The input is an ordered listing of the pieces of the snake puzzle where 'S' corresponds to a straight piece and 'E' correspods to an elbow piece. The solution that is output is a string of ordered moves of the snake puzzle, where 'L', 'R', 'U' and 'D' correspond to moves of left, right, up and down.
